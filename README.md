# Warhammer-Ebay-Scrape
I started getting into Warhammer AOS (Age of Sigmar) miniatures. I decided to build a web scrape script to scrape Ebay and find any Warhammer AOS minis and categorise them from Title, Price and Link in a CSV file. Now this is something I did for my own needs, but this can be completely customizable to anyone else's needs.
